I'm Song-Zi (尚志) Vong, born and raised in a small town in southern China, then studied in [Guangzhou](https://goo.gl/maps/7X8aPfSvS23Y3ens7), dreaming of becoming a physicist. But I failed, and later became a game programmer by accident. Now I am a freelancer living in [Shenzhen](https://goo.gl/maps/qwYBJnmTnT1kLcxN8).
